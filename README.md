# MCG Front End Developer Test

Web page built with React.

## [Demo](https://oplevan-mcg-test.netlify.app/)

## Description

This is a test project I've been given from a company for Front End Developer role. I chose React because it's fast, scalable, and simple. And because I love it.
This project has multiple reusable components, custom font, and it's fully responsive. Check out the live demo by clicking the link below

## Front End Technical Challenge:

To recreate the design in as much detail and as accurately as possible, whilst being fully responsive. 

Minimum requirements: 

* Use WordPress (or your favorite technology) with a custom theme created by yourself 
(feel free to use a framework like Bedrock or Sage if that's your thing - but no pre-made themes!)
* Make the site as responsive as possible
* Recreate the design as closely as possible
* Host the files in a public Github / Gitlab / Bitbucket repository
* Document your work and explain your decisions
* Hoste the project on a server (optional)
